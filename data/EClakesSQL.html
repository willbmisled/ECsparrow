<!---
use these command instead of the knit icon if you want the data and work loaded into the R workspace
First make sure you are in the data directory: 
  getwd()
  setwd('data')
  library(knitr)
  knit('EClakesSQL.rmd')
  
Some useful RSQLite commands
      EC<-dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname='EClakes.sqlite')
      dbListTables(EC)                         # List the tables in the database

<p>Definition of attributes from the &ldquo;massbalancereservoirs&rdquo;  data sets  (output from  postprocessing  of NHDPlus  SPARROW model runs)
The file lists results for each of the 17,885 lakes/reservoirs in MRB1 and the 23,681 lakes/reservoirs in MRB2 (corresponding to the unique waterbody reach codes for each MRB) that are simulated as a lake or reservoir in the current (August 2013) version of the SPARROW model for the northeast (hydroregion 01 and 02). 
The attributes in red (see XLSX files) are reported in the tables in Appendix 1 of Moorman and others, 2014, U.S. Geological Survey Data Series Report 820.   (results are reported for &#39;large lakes&#39; (surface area &gt;= 5 square kilometers)
          Moorman, M.C., Hoos, A.B., Bricker, S.B., Moore, R.B., García, A.M., and Ator, S.W., 2014, Nutrient load summaries for major lakes and estuaries of the Eastern United States, 2002: U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 820, 94 p.,  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ds820">http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ds820</a>.
With one important exception (explained in next sentence), we chose to report in the DS Report 820 appendix tables  the &ldquo;input&rdquo; part of the mass balance rather than the &ldquo;output&rdquo;(because the report focused on loads entering lakes/reservoirs/estuaries. 
      The one exception to this is the estimate of &ldquo;Total load&rdquo; and &ldquo;Total yield&rdquo;,  reported along with source share percentages in DS Report 820.  We tried but found it messy to compute source shares percentages accurately for  for loads entering the lake from the various tributaries and lakeshore catchments, so the percentages pertain to outflow (i.e. are for load at downstream end of outlet reach).
      To be consistent with how the source share percentages are derived, therefore,  we reported the outflow  load and yield values in the source share table</p>
